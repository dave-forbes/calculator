# Calculator

From Odin Project.

Live demo - https://dave-forbes.github.io/calculator/

# Technologies used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

# Conclusion

It was great to practise and solidify my javascript knowledge in this project, I found I was able to create the logic and solve any bugs faster than before and just generally feel more confident.

After completing the javascript course in the full stack javascript path I came back with extra knowledge to create calculator v2 which had a nicer looking UI and more way more features as well as any bugs resolved from previous version.

Features

- Instant evaluation.
- Clear error handling.
- Responsive design for all devices.
- Clean and clear UI.
- Keyboard and click input with visual feedback.
- Calculator memory add, subtract and recall.
