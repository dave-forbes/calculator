# Calculator

From Odin Project.

Live demo - https://dave-forbes.github.io/calculator/

# Technologies used 

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

# Conclusion

It was great to practise and solidify my javascript knowledge in this project, I found I was able to create the logic and solve any bugs faster than before and just generally feel more confident. 

# TODO 

* MRC, M+ and M- aren't functional yet.
* code in the script.js file is messy and needs to be tidied up / optimsed.
* Some bugs involving text overflowing to the left of the display.
* The modulo function doesn't 100% work for all numbers yet.
* Dividing by 0 should display 'Impossible...' but for some reason doesn't. 
* Would be cool to add an ON function so that you can turn it on before doing any calulations.
